Levo minha mãe comigo
Embora ja se tenha ido
Levo minha mãe comigo
Talvez por sermos tão parecidos

Your mommas baby
Your mommas momma
Your sister
Your aunties sister
Your grandma
Your great great gram

She said, 'put all the bad things away'
I see
I see
I see us coming out of hate
I see us coming out of deaths
I see us coming out of fear
But will we listen?
We don't hear
But when the bomb drop
We all fear
This year, next year
Same year
Fuck what you heard
I'm right here
Same place since I been here

She said, 'put all the bad shit away'
Momma made a circle that will keep us all safe

The litany is long
Always listening to these songs
Still with something on my tongue
Take me back to where I'm from
Missing the sun
When can I handle the sons
I'll probably have one
Raise me a few
Say 'Jamal' when the summer is new
There's something to say about circles
About forward motions that are running right back
Young didn't know
Didn't really want it like that
Don't see the sums of the ones before
That we report of sorts
Don't really enforce with a similar force
Simpler times aren't really that far
As moms would offer the arms I ought
Trust my heart
Till I'm back at start
Pull my cards
While I push this cart of bars

Your mommas baby
Your mommas momma
Your sister
Your aunties sister
Your grandma
Your great great gram
Your nanas sister
They made a circle out of sage and gold

Shining our souls because of them
The whole world up under them
Their bosoms' like a tunnel
Soon to run into the sun
Cyphering the skills
Each generation heals from trauma
A little more
They set the score
The precedent
They built the floor
The ceiling is irrelevant
We want more for the betterment
Of our whole
Momma holds us close so they can't hold us
Old wisdom knows this well
She pulls us in and tell us secrets
Feeds us with her well, she preaches
Wellness. Beat the bell
It rings and shatters all the stigma
The enigma is a pattern
Passed down like matter
Brings this gift to give that we matter
We no different from them
We make a difference after we witness their valor
Their spirit is ours

Your mommas baby
Your mommas momma
Your sister
Your aunties sister
Your grandma
Your great great gram
Your nanas sister
They made a circle out of sage and gold

They made a circle out of sage and gold
